You will write class methods that evaluate a WFF at a given truth assignment and that produce a string representation of a WFF suitable for use with the Python `print` function.  You will also write a functions for checking logical equivalences between WFFs represented by instances of your class.\n",

    "## Part 1 - the WFF class and subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when we write classes we come across a situation where one type of object is a special kind of another type. For example, we might have a class `Person` representing people and a class `Student` representing students. Every student is also a person, so every `Student` object should also be a `Person` and be able to do everything a `Person` can do. We say that the class `Student` is a *subclass* of `Person` and that the `Student` should *inherit* the methods and instance variables from `Person`.  To make this happen we define the `Person` class as usual and then do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "    # class definition goes here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing `Student(Person)` ensures that a `Student` is a special kind of `Person` and that an instance of the `Student` class will be able to use any methods defined in `Person`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Algebra 1 you saw that there were five different kinds of WFF:\n",
    "\n",
    " - a propositional variable\n",
    " - a WFF of the form $\\neg \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is a WFF\n",
    " - a WFF of the form $(\\phi \\wedge \\psi)$, where $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are WFFs\n",
    " - a WFF of the form $(\\phi \\vee \\psi)$, where $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are WFFs\n",
    " - a WFF of the form $(\\phi \\implies \\psi)$, where $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are WFFs\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these is a \"special kind of WFF\", so we will use a single class `WFF` with five subclasses `PropVarWFF`, `NotWFF`, `AndWFF`, `OrWFF`, and `ImpliesWFF` to represent our formulas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The classes `AndWFF`, `OrWFF`, and `ImpliesWFF` will each have two instance variables `left` and `right` which represent the WFFs on the left and the right of the connective. As an example, given two `WFF`s `phi` and `psi` (of any kind) people using the class must be able to create an `AndWFF` that represents `(phi ∧ psi)` by calling `AndWFF(phi, psi)`, which should set the `left` instance variable of the `AndWFF` object to `phi` and the `right` instance variable to `psi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `NotWFF` should have a single instance variable `formula`, which will be a `WFF` of any kind. `NotWFF(formula)` will represent `¬ formula`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PropVarWFF` will have a single instance variable `name`, which will be a string. `PropVarWFF(\"p\")`, for example, will represent a WFF which is a propositional variable called `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in part 1 is to **write the `__init__` method for each of these five classes in the code cells below**.  Don't make any changes to the `WFF` class itself yet.  I have written the `__init__` function for `AndWFF` for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment these classes won't do anything at all (in fact, trying to run the cells will give an error because the class bodies are empty). We will add functionality in the next three parts."

It just needs to return the instance variable `self.name`.  On the other hand the `__str__(self)` method of the `NotWFF` class should print out a `¬` symbol and then the string representation of the `formula` instance variable, so you will have to call the `__str__` method of `self.formula`. Recall that you can join two strings together with `+`.\n",

Please remember that just because your implementations of `__str__` work for these cases does not mean that they work for *any* WFF, and to get full marks your code must be correct in general.  You may want to add further tests to see if your code works for other WFFs."

    "(Want to take this project further? Here are some suggestions.  You could try to implement `__eq__`, for which you'll need to learn about the `isinstance` function. You could write a function that returns the set containing the names of the propositional variables involved in a WFF, and use it to improve the function in Part 4 so that we didn't have to supply a list of variables.  You could write a new set of classes that can cope with more general formulas like `(p ∧ q ∧ r)`.....  You won't get any more marks for doing this, but you will certainly learn something about programming and classes)"
